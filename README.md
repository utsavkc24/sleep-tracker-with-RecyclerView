## SleepQualityTracker with RecyclerView

This app builds on the SleepQualityTracker you developed in Lesson 6.  In this lesson you'll learn how to display a list of results in a RecyclerView instead of a static ScrollView. You'll also learn how you can refactor your code to make it more efficient so it will be easier to maintain and test.
